I will start my PhD this August in the [Offshore Engineering Section](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ceg/about-faculty/departments/hydraulic-engineering/sections/offshore-engineering) of the Civil Engineering and Geosciences Department, working in the [Computational Multiphysics in Offshore Engineering](https://tudelftcmoe.super.site/) lab at the [Delft University of Technology (TU Delft)](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/). 

My interest is in developing generalisable numerical methods and computational tools for solving partial differential equations, particularly in the areas of finite element methods, domain decomposition methods, high-performance computing and multi-physics problems. 

I am currently working on developing computational methods to simulate offshore floating structures with a focus on floating solar.
